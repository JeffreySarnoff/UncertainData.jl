# [Theoretical distributions](@id uncertain_value_theoretical_distribution)

It is common in the scientific literature to encounter uncertain data values
which are reported as following a specific distribution. For example, an author
report the mean and standard deviation of a value stated to follow a
normal distribution. `UncertainData.jl` makes it easy to represent such values!
