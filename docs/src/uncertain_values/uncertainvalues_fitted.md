# [Fitted theoretical distributions](@id uncertain_value_fitted_theoretical_distribution)

For data values with histograms close to some known distribution, the user
may choose to represent the data by fitting a theoretical distribution to the
values. This will only work well if the histogram closely resembles a
theoretical distribution.
